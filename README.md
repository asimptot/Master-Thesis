The firm where the study will be carried out is the electronics factory. Examinations are carried out in the test section of the R&D department of this factory. 
In this section, television software goes through the weekly approval stage before production approval. Each tester had a fixed weekly assignment in the R&D department of a consumer electronics manufacturer. 

Here, inefficiencies such as lack of qualification and time loss observed as problems were determined. 
In order to solve these problems, all the work was done to all workers first. 
As a result of the points they got from their jobs, it was determined whether they were qualified in that job. When a new worker is to be recruited, the job proposal is made based on the common features of the qualified workers. 
Machine learning algorithms are used here.

In the task assignment part, the points that users get from each task, the additional time they worked in the company and the maximum task time of each worker are taken as basis. 
Subsequently, the parameters and decision variables were determined. 
The testers who have fixed values as parameters, the scores they get per task, their annual leave, the number of testers and tasks, and the deadlines of the tasks have been determined. 
As a decision variable, the information on whether a worker is assigned to a task, the amount of time the tester worked, the amount of additional and regular work hours of the tester, the amount of time spent per worker in order to identify the workers who could not be assigned the task, and the maximum task time amount of a worker were determined.

A job in the constraints be made whether more than one person, task duration of the set without exceeding the amount of work the week of the workers, overtime amount of time the legally defined in Turkey per worker, had worked at the factory workers of the total of pure working time with overtime amounts to equality, regular time amount of Turkey The equivalent of the calculation of the amount of idle time, the implementation of fair work distribution has taken place in. 
After the constraints determined, task assignment operations are applied by two different methods through mathematical modeling. 
In the weighted-sum method, assignment is applied according to a single objective function. 
In the Lexicographic method, it is aimed to find values by giving weight to the decision variables and parameters used in the objective function.
